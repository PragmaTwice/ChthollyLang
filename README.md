# Chtholly Lang
*A **simple implmentation** of Yet another script language Chtholly*

## Requires
* Compiler with C++17 support (necessary)
* Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 15.5 (optional)

*You can use MSVC 2017 15.5 to compile it without any modification*

*Because of terrible support for C++17 in MSVC 15.5, I did some ill-looking work to make it compile successfully*

## Language Feature
* No statement but all **expression**

## Implmentation Feature
* Functional usage of C++ (with little consideration of runtime performance)
* Parser Combinator for LL Parser Generation
